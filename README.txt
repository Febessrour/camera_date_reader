This branch is about my poor attempt of creating a script that reads the timestamp on the bottom-right
corner of a photo. I will give up for now as it's late tonight and I'm pretty sure my problem can be
solved with an easier script that doesn't require vision and playing with filters on photos. I will
come back to this branch one day just for fun, but if you read this far and you're interested in this,
I left some .jpg images and one .png for you to test on right away. HF.

Here is where I got the script example from:
